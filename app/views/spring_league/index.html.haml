      Spring Boys 4x4 League
      %small March 20 - April 14, 2019

      Boys volleyball is growing in Ohio! 85 High schools now have boys programs and 7 universities have added varsity programs in the last 5 years with more to follow next year. Now is the perfect time to see if your son has the skills to be a volleyball player. The one regret High School players have is that they did not start playing sooner, largely because the opportunities did not exist then, but they do now!
